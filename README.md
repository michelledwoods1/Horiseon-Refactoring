# Horiseon Refactor

## Description

Task: To refactor existing website code in order to improve user accessiblity.

Without changing the actions of the existing code, **"clean"** the codebase to:
- meet accessibility standards ie. semantic HTML
- ensure code sustainability ie. relevant commenting, consolidated CSS and working Links

By following and meeting accessiblity standards, the refactored website will be:
- search engine optimised ie. rank higher
- accessible to people with disabilities (thereby avoiding possible litigation)
